# ResLPR

## Introduction
Welcome to the ResLPR project! This repository is dedicated to the research and development of ResLPR: A LiDAR Data Restoration Network and Benchmark for
Robust Place Recognition Against Weather Corruptions.

## Dataset and Code Availability
We are excited to announce that the dataset and code related to ResLPR will be made open-source soon. Our goal is to provide the community with valuable resources to further research and innovation in the field of robust perception of point clouds in severe weather.

## Timeline
We are currently in the process of preparing the dataset and code for release. Please stay tuned for updates.
